AUCTION - US 4

We prompted ChatGPT with the prompt below. We asked for the logic class based on the test method that we developed.
/*____________________*/
PROMPT:
You are a software developer in a test driven development team, your task is to write

class auction.AwardItem

for the following test case:

| TC1 - awardItemTest | An auction is closed, and a single highest bid exists. | The system should award the item to the highest bidder and notify them. | The highest bidder is awarded the item and notified. The auction is removed from the system. |
| TC2 - awardItemTest | An auction is closed, and multiple users have placed the same highest bid at the last moment. | The system should request a new bid from the tied users. | The tied users are asked to place a new higher bid. |
| TC3 - awardItemTest | After a tie in bidding, users submit the same highest bid again. | The seller should decide the winner before timeout. | The seller selects the winner, and the auction is awarded accordingly. |
| TC4 - awardItemTest | No bids have been placed, or the seller does not make a decision after a tie. | The seller should have the option to relist the auction. | The seller can create the auction with new dates. |

using stubs and drivers.

Here is the test written so far with JUnit5, along with the error trace:

@Test
    public void awardItem() {
        int[] auctions = new int[]{400, 500, 700};
        auction.AwardItem.addFinalAuctions(auctions);
        assertTrue(auction.AwardItem.awardItem(auctions));

        auctions = new int[]{400, 500 ,500};
        auction.AwardItem.addFinalAuctions(auctions);
        assertTrue(auction.AwardItem.requestNewBid(auctions));

        int[] auctionsAfterTie = new int[]{700, 700};
        auction.AwardItem.addFinalAuctions(auctions);
        assertTrue(auction.AwardItem.decideWinner(auctionsAfterTie));

        auctions = new int[]{};
        auction.AwardItem.addFinalAuctions(auctions);
        assertFalse(auction.AwardItem.awardItem(auctions));
    }

Error trace:

java: cannot find symbol
  symbol:   variable auction.AwardItem
  location: class auction.AuctionTest


RESULT:
The code works as expected and the test passes.
