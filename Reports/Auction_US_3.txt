AUCTION - US 3

TC - 1
We prompted ChatGPT with the prompt below. We asked for the logic class based on the test method that we developed.
/*____________________*/
PROMPT:
You are a software developer in a test driven development team, your task is to write

class auction.CheckRemainingTime

for the following test case:

| **Test Case** | **Input** | **Description** | **Expected Behaviour** |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|------------------------|
| TC1 - checkRemainingTimeTest | An auction is ongoing, and the remaining time is positive. | The system should compute and display the remaining time along with auction details. | The remaining time is displayed correctly along with auction details. |


using stubs and drivers.

Here is the test written so far with JUnit5, along with the error trace:

@Test
    public void checkRemainingTime() {
        auction.CheckRemainingTime.setRemainingTime(142.76);
        assertTrue(auction.CheckRemainingTime.getRemainingTime() > 0.0);
    }
Error trace:

java: cannot find symbol
  symbol:   variable auction.CheckRemainingTime


RESULT:
The code works as expected and the test passes.

We wrote the following test, that run successfully.

    @Test
    public void checkRemainingTime2() {
        auction.CheckRemainingTime.setRemainingTime(0.0);
        assertFalse(auction.CheckRemainingTime.getRemainingTime() > 0.0);
    }
