--- Workload Distribution ---

The AuctionTest part was carried out during the first lab of testing. We wrote the tests, prompted ChatGPT
and inserted the additional classes together.

As for the other two tests (Seller and User), we decided to split the work. We did them on our own and compared the results
during the lab classes.

--- Work backlog ---

This section aims to describe how we followed the Test Driven Development (TDD) approach.
We first wrote the tests and run them. Then, we prompted ChatGPT with the test just written and the error trace
(the exact prompt can be found in the reports). Consequently, we added the classes given by ChatGPT into our project
and run the test again.

The documentation of the steps and the interactions with ChatGPT is in the Auction_Report, Seller_Report and User_Report.

--- Testing types ---

We opted for different kinds of tests.
The AuctionTest comprises static tests, because at the time the dynamic tests were not explained yet.
The SellerTest and UserTest adopt, on the other hand, the dynamic test approach: in the UserTest we used an Iterator over a list,
whereas in the SellerTest we implemented the Supplier/Consumer strategy within the Stream.
