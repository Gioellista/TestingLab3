USER STORY 1

We prompted ChatGPT with the prompt below. We asked for the logic class based on the test method that we developed.

    You are a software developer in a test driven development team, your task is to write class 'auction.RegisterBid' for the following test cases:

    | TC1: registerBidTest | Input: User places a bid that is the current auction price plus a positive multiple of the auction bid increment. | Description: Verify that a valid bid is successfully registered. | Expected behaviour: The bid is registered, and the auction price is updated. |
    | TC2: registerBidTest | User places a bid that is not the current auction price plus a positive multiple of the auction bid increment. | Verify that an error message is displayed for an invalid bid. | An error message is shown, and the bid is not registered. |

    using stubs and drivers.

    Here is the test written so far with JUnit5, along with the error trace:

    @Test
    public void registerBid() {
          RegisterBid.setBasePrice(400);
          RegisterBid.setIncrement(10);
          Assertions.assertTrue(RegisterBid.registerBid(500));
          Assertions.assertFalse(RegisterBid.registerBid(495));
    }

     Error trace:

     java: cannot find symbol
       symbol:   variable auction.RegisterBid

RESULT:
The code, that ChatGPT provided us with (RegisterBid.java), works as expected and the test passes.

USER STORY 2

We prompted ChatGPT with the prompt below. We asked for the logic class based on the test method that we developed.

    You are a software developer in a test driven development team, your task is to write class 'auction.IsOngoing' for the following test cases:

    | TC1: isOngoingTest | Auction is created, system time is before the start time | Verify that an auction before its start time is not flagged as ongoing | Auction is flagged as "Not Started" |
    | TC2: isOngoingTest | Auction is created, system time is within the start and end time | Verify that an auction within the start and end time is flagged as ongoing | Auction is flagged as "Ongoing" |
    | TC3: isOngoingTest | Auction is created, system time is after the end time | Verify that an auction after its end time is not flagged as ongoing | Auction is flagged as "Closed" |

    using stubs and drivers.

    Here is the test written so far with JUnit5, along with the error trace:

    @Test
    public void isOngoing(){
             IsOngoing.setStartTime("8:00 16/06/2023");
             IsOngoing.setEndTime("11:00 16/06/2023");
             IsOngoing.setCurrentTime("8:00 15/06/2023");
             Assertions.assertFalse(IsOngoing.isOngoing(IsOngoing.getCurrentTime()));
             IsOngoing.setCurrentTime("8:30 16/06/2023");
             Assertions.assertTrue(IsOngoing.isOngoing(IsOngoing.getCurrentTime()));
             IsOngoing.setCurrentTime("12:30 17/06/2023");
             Assertions.assertFalse(IsOngoing.isOngoing(IsOngoing.getCurrentTime()));
    }

     Error trace:

     java: cannot find symbol
       symbol:   variable auction.isOngoing

RESULT:
The code, that ChatGPT provided us with (isOngoing.java), works as expected and the test passes.

USER STORY 3

We prompted ChatGPT with the prompt below. We asked for the logic class based on the test method that we developed.

    You are a software developer in a test driven development team, your task is to write class 'auction.CheckRemainingTime' for the following test cases:

    | TC1 - checkRemainingTimeTest | An auction is ongoing, and the remaining time is positive. | The system should compute and display the remaining time along with auction details. | The remaining time is displayed correctly along with auction details. |
    | TC2 - checkRemainingTimeTest | An auction is ongoing, but the remaining time is zero. | The system should check the remaining time and determine that bidding is no longer possible. | A warning message is shown indicating that bidding is no longer possible. |

    using stubs and drivers.

    Here is the test written so far with JUnit5, along with the error trace:

    @Test
    public void checkRemainingTime() {
            CheckRemainingTime.setRemainingTime(142.76);
            assertTrue(CheckRemainingTime.getRemainingTime() > 0.0);
            CheckRemainingTime.setRemainingTime(0.0);
            assertFalse(CheckRemainingTime.getRemainingTime() > 0.0);
    }

    Error trace:

    java: cannot find symbol
      symbol:   variable auction.checkRemainingTime

RESULT:
The code, that ChatGPT provided us with (checkRemainingTime.java), works as expected and the test passes.

USER STORY 4

We prompted ChatGPT with the prompt below. We asked for the logic class based on the test method that we developed.

    You are a software developer in a test driven development team, your task is to write class 'auction.AwardItem' for the following test cases:

    | TC1 - awardItemTest | An auction is closed, and a single highest bid exists. | The system should award the item to the highest bidder and notify them. | The highest bidder is awarded the item and notified. The auction is removed from the system. |
    | TC2 - awardItemTest | An auction is closed, and multiple users have placed the same highest bid at the last moment. | The system should request a new bid from the tied users. | The tied users are asked to place a new higher bid. |
    | TC3 - awardItemTest | After a tie in bidding, users submit the same highest bid again. | The seller should decide the winner before timeout. | The seller selects the winner, and the auction is awarded accordingly. |
    | TC4 - awardItemTest | No bids have been placed, or the seller does not make a decision after a tie. | The seller should have the option to relist the auction. | The seller can create the auction with new dates. |

    using stubs and drivers.

    Here is the test written so far with JUnit5, along with the error trace:

    @Test
    public void awardItem() {
            int[] auctions = new int[]{400, 500, 700};
            AwardItem.addFinalAuctions(auctions);
            assertTrue(AwardItem.awardItem(auctions));

            auctions = new int[]{400, 500 ,500};
            AwardItem.addFinalAuctions(auctions);
            assertTrue(AwardItem.requestNewBid(auctions));

            int[] auctionsAfterTie = new int[]{700, 700};
            AwardItem.addFinalAuctions(auctions);
            assertTrue(AwardItem.decideWinner(auctionsAfterTie));

            auctions = new int[]{};
            AwardItem.addFinalAuctions(auctions);
            assertFalse(AwardItem.awardItem(auctions));
    }

    Error trace:

    java: cannot find symbol
      symbol:   variable auction.awardItem
