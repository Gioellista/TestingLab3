AUCTION - US 1

TC - 1
We prompted ChatGPT with the prompt below. We asked for the logic class based on the test method that we developed.
/*____________________*/
PROMPT 1:

You are a software developer in a test driven development team, your task is to write

class RegisterBid

for the following test case:

| TC1: registerBidTest | Input: User places a bid that is the current auction price plus a positive multiple of the auction bid increment. | Description: Verify that a valid bid is successfully registered. | Expected behaviour: The bid is registered, and the auction price is updated. |

using stubs and drivers.

Here is the test written so far with JUnit5, along with the error trace:

@Test
    public void registerBid(){
        RegisterBid.setBasePrice(400);
        RegisterBid.setIncrement(10);
        assertTrue(RegisterBid.registerBid(500));
    }

Error trace:

java: cannot find symbol
  symbol:   variable RegisterBid


RESULT:
The code works as expected and the test passes.

TC - 2
We wrote the following test, that run successfully.

@Test
    public void registerBid2(){
        RegisterBid.setBasePrice(400);
        RegisterBid.setIncrement(10);
        assertFalse(RegisterBid.registerBid(495));
    }
